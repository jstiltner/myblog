    <p>Every student at NSS needs to relax and consider the future her new skills will allow her to build. No novel could be better for this than Daniel Suarez's <em>Daemon</em> <a href="https://www.sfsite.com/grc/0904/da.jpg">Books</a>
    series produced by PBS. It's one of my favorite series of all time, and I make them watch it so that they never forget wy we're here, and always appreciate the benefits of how our political structure.</p>

    <p>Not unlike Steve, I am a bad bad man when it comes to a BBQ pit and a rack of ribs.  Smoked Beer chicken, Boston Butt, and (messed up) chicken wings are the other things I've tried my hand smoking in the three or four weeks since I acquired my favorite piece of outdoor cooking paraphenalia.</p>

    <p>Though my recent weeks have been spent watching 18-month old Lillian at home, I have had a project on ice for far too long. <a href="http://www.househunthelp.com">House Hunt Help</a>. I'm <strong>so</strong> excited to get this site functional, because I think it may pay for my education here at NSS.

    <p>I continue to transact as a realtor through <a href="http://www.twrightproperties.com/">T. Wright Properties</a>, a Murfreesboro-based third generation family business run by a friend I first met in 6th grade.
    <p>I'm excited about addressing pain points in the broader business world with technological solutions. I love to disrupt market dynamics and believe that we are only seeing the beginnings of the effects of the internet on the bricks and mortar world.</p>
